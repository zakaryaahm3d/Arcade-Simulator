# Arcade-Simulator
Our simulator features two custom-designed games:

🎮 Eat the Emoji – our twist on the classic Snake Game, with emojis for extra flavor!

🐦 Basim Bird – a fun remake of Flappy Bird (yes, named after our teammate Basim!)

We aimed to make the simulator not just functional, but engaging and user-friendly. It includes:

📋 Clear instructions for each game

🏆 High score tracking to fuel your competitive side

🎵 Music toggles to vibe while you play

🚪 Exit option to wrap up your gaming session


This project was a great way to apply our understanding of object-oriented design, game logic, and interactive UI using SFML.
